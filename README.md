My favorite way to study has always been making study guides and what I call "cheat sheets" for a quicker reference than a full study guide. By the time I finished studying for Security+, I ended up with 4 different study guides and cheat sheets, all for different purposes. I keep all my notes and still use them as references whenever I can. Sometimes, I even still catch myself repeating definitions I struggled to remember and had to force into my brain. S/MIME, I'm looking at you!
